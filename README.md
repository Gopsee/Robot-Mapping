# Robot Mapping

Mapping the environment assuming the pose of the robot, where the map is previously not available. Mapping is a continous process and is more computationally intense  compared to Localization.

We have Occupany Grid Mapping Example from Udacity Robotic Software Engineer Nanodegree.

Please see MapMyWorld Repository for the Complete SLAM project.
