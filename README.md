# Robot Mapping

Mapping the environment assuming the pose of the robot, where the map is previously not available. Mapping is a continous process and is more computationally intense  compared to Localization.

We have Occupany Grid Mapping Example from Udacity Robotic Software Engineer Nanodegree.

SLAM(Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) is a complete cycle of Mapping and Localization. This is very useful for a robot to be deployed in an unknown environment. 

Please see MapMyWorld Repository for the Complete SLAM project.
